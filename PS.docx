Applying creativity to the use of technology has always been a central aspect of my endeavours. My interest in computing has come from the usage of technology, as well as how it has impacted on our method of communication and application in everyday, real-life situations. I want to learn further the needs users and organisations have when employing and interacting through digital technologies.
My studies have especially enables me to develop the skills needed to assume my choice course, simply as they involve enthusiastically and ably using a computer. From this, I have been able to effectively work in a study routine as well as frequently explore the effect of human-computer interactivity.
I feel I have thoroughly understood various areas of my interest through my current course in Computing BSc. I have become familiar with using command language interpreters and have participated in a project focusing on developing a multiplayer game (tic-tac-toe) running over a server to enable users to play against one another or the computer. I have also come to understand programming with languages Python and JavaScript, in which I have enjoyed learning and implementing the various code types, methods and syntaxes including condition and loop statements, object-orientated programming with classes and functions, the differentiation of array types such as lists, tuples and dictionaries.
During my time studying Foundation Year in Computing, I have also learned programming with JavaScript in a more comprehensive level through using the software Processing. I also have enjoyed exploring ways of creating and performing graphic objects and animations.
I first grasped an understand of the advantages of computing through my A-level ICT course, where I have produced webpage documents containing a range of multimedia components – animation, videos, etc. – from using software such as Adobe Flash, Fireworks and Dreamweaver, comprising my e-portfolio. Here, I was introduced to the implementation of programming languages ActionScript, JavaScript and HTML, all of which helped resolve technical complications. Media Studies has supplemented my knowledge of computing in a sociological and theoretical sense. Here, I have enjoyed learning about the influence of digital technologies on the media industry and methods of marketing, such as convergence, through post-production tasks and web design research. I have also learned the creative aspects of computing through studying Digital Photography, where I familiarised myself with the technicalities behind photography, such as digital manipulation using Adobe Photoshop, the systems within the SLR camera and how computers interpret images and colour (RGB colour model, bit depth, etc).
My experience as a trainee CAD technician at Thomasons LLP, an engineering firm, had expanded my interest in computing. There, I gained knowledge of how technology has impacted significantly on the general workplace. In becoming familiar with ‘AutoCAD 2010’, a software which the staff often used for their tasks and duties, I mainly developed observational and mathematical skills. In later working as a sales assistant at Dune, I have enjoyed achieving further capacities such as database handling and research, reliability and communication skills with customers and colleagues as well as initiative in fast-paced situations.
My general interests include photography and videography. I enjoy drawing as well as reading, writing and sports. I also enjoy building websites using Adobe Dreamweaver, particularly for my personal visual arts portfolio, where I learn various technical approaches.
As technology is constantly changing, I want to understand the science of modern technologies and seek the possibilities for innovative practice. After careful consideration, I wish to switch from my current university to Coventry in Year One and I have been informed via email that I have been accepted a place on the course with the condition achieving 60% in my current course to pass. There, I feel the course will be better suited to helping me achieve creative capabilities in computing and a clearer view of how I can apply them to a potential career in software development or web design.
