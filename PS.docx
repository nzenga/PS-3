Applying creativity to the use of technology has always been a central aspect of my endeavours. My interest in computing has come from the usage of technology, as well as how it has impacted on our method of communication and application in everyday, real-life situations. I want to further learn the needs users have when experiencing and interacting with digital technologies.
My studies have especially enables me to develop the skills needed to assume my choice course, simply as they involve enthusiastically and ably using a computer. From this, I have been able to effectively work in a study routine as well as frequently explore the effect of human-computer interactivity.
I feel I have thoroughly understood various areas of my interest through my current course in Computing BSc. I have become familiar with using command language interpreters and have participated in a project focusing on developing a multiplayer game (tic-tac-toe) running over a server to enable users to play against one another or the computer. I have also come to understand programming with languages Python and JavaScript, in which I have enjoyed learning and implementing the various code types, methods and syntaxes including condition and loop statements, object-orientated programming with classes and functions, the differentiation of array types such as lists, tuples and dictionaries. In my previous time studying Foundation Year in Computing, I have learned programming with JavaScript at length, using the software Processing, where I have enjoyed developing audio-visual media and animations.
I first grasped an understanding of computing through my A-level ICT course, where I have produced webpage documents containing animation, videos and other multimedia from using software such as Dreamweaver and Flash, comprising my e-portfolio. Here, I was introduced to the implementation of programming languages ActionScript, JavaScript and HTML, all of which helped resolve technical complications. Other studies of this qualification that have supplemented my knowledge include Media Studies, where I learned the influence of digital technologies on the media industry and marketing and took on production tasks and web development; and Digital Photography, where I practiced digital manipulation using Adobe Photoshop, learned the systems within the SLR camera and how computers interpret graphics (bit depth, colour modes, etc).
My work experience has extended my interest in computing. Working at Dune as a sales assistant has enabled me to gain several capabilities such as data handling, peer-to-peer communication and quick, initiative thinking. As a CAD technician in training at a civil engineering firm, I acquired knowledge of the influence technology has had on nature of the workplace in general. I mainly developed observational and mathematical skills whilst familiarising myself with AutoCAD, a software which the staff frequently employed to carry out their duties.
My pastimes include building websites in HTML and CSS, where I learn various approaches in resolving technical conflicts. I also take pleasure in drawing, photography, videography as well as participating in sport activities.
Technology is constantly evolving and because of this I want to understand the science behind modern technologies and seek the innovative possibilities from its application in real-life practices. After careful consideration, I wish to switch from my current university to Coventry in Year One and I have been informed via email that I have been accepted a place on the course with the condition achieving 60% in my current course to pass. There, I feel the course will be better suited to helping me achieve creative capabilities in computing and a clearer view of how I can apply them to a potential career in software development or web design.
