Technology and creativity have always been involved in my activities and ventures. My awareness of how technology has impacted on the way individuals’ communicate, interact and apply in everyday circumstances has led to my interest in studying Computing. I want to learn further the needs of users and organisations interacting through and employing digital technologies.
My studies have particularly helped me develop the key skills needed to take on my choice course, simply as they involve using a computer, ably and enthusiastically. This has enabled me to work in an effective study routine and explore continually the effect of human-computer interactivity.
I feel I have grasped an in-depth understanding of my interest through the Foundation Year for Computing course which I am currently studying. I have familiarised myself with the software Processing as an approach of learning programming with JavaScript in a more comprehensive level. I have adapted to implementing different coding methods, including the declaration and initialization of variables; making and sorting arrays using different algorithms; loop and conditional statements, etc. I also have enjoyed exploring ways of creating and performing graphic objects and animations. The topic areas I have learned through the mathematics module extend from those in previous years, including elementary logic, functions, rearranging formulae, etc. all of which come into application in programming.
For my A-level ICT course, I have produced an e-portfolio of works, including webpage documents containing a range of multimedia components – animation, videos, etc. – from using software such as Adobe Flash, Fireworks and Dreamweaver. The skills I have developed involve implementing coding methods such as ActionScript, JavaScript and HTML, all of which helped resolve technical complications. Media Studies has supplemented my knowledge of computing in a sociological and theoretical sense. Here, I have enjoyed learning about the influence of digital technologies on the media industry and methods of marketing, such as convergence, through post-production tasks and web design research. I have also learned the creative aspects of computing through studying Digital Photography, where I familiarised myself with the technicalities behind photography, such as digital manipulation using Adobe Photoshop, the systems within the SLR camera and how computers interpret images and colour (RGB colour model, bit depth, etc).
My experience as a trainee CAD technician at Thomasons LLP, an engineering firm, had expanded my interest in computing. There, I gained knowledge of how technology has impacted significantly on the general workplace. In becoming familiar with ‘AutoCAD 2010’, a software which the staff often used for their tasks and duties, I mainly developed observational and mathematical skills. In later working as a sales assistant at Dune, I have enjoyed achieving further capacities such as database handling and research, reliability and communication skills with customers and colleagues as well as initiative in fast-paced situations.
My general interests include photography and videography. I enjoy drawing as well as reading, writing and sports. I also enjoy building websites using Adobe Dreamweaver, particularly for my personal visual arts portfolio, where I learn various technical approaches.
As technology is constantly changing, I want to understand the science of modern technologies and seek the possibilities for innovative practice. After careful consideration, I wish to switch from my current university to Coventry in Year One and I have been informed via email that I have been accepted a place on the course with the condition achieving 60% in my current course to pass. There, I feel the course will be better suited to helping me achieve creative capabilities in computing and a clearer view of how I can apply them to a potential career in software development or web design.
